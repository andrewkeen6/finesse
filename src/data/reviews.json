Therefore, it is a rarity nowadays to see someone like Scott at Finesse Detailing, who brings out the best in people’s cars, by being extremely knowledgeable, detail oriented, professional, and delivering customer service on a level that I’ve never seen before.",

Scott is so meticulous, he takes such great care and pride in his work. If you want your vehicle looking brand new again this is hands down the best place to bring it.",

      "text": "A mouse died somewhere in my old Ford sedan recently.  So, I called Scott at Finesse Detailing and he offered to help me that afternoon, immediately!  He was in the midst of other jobs, but he took a good 15 minutes to try to get the dead animal out of the car.  No luck with the \"Quickie Service,\" but when I gave him the car for the official appointment a few days later, everything was made perfect.   Outstanding results, kind, professional service.  I highly, highly recommend Finesse Detailing for any automotive or marine detailing needs.  You will be thrilled!",
